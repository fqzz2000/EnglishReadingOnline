    passage: "<p>Climatic changes such as changes in temperature, precipitation, humid ity, or wind speed that are produced by urbanization involve all major surface conditions. Some of these changes are quite obvious and relatively easy to measure.\
    Others are more subtle and sometimes difficult to measure. The amount of change in any of these elements, at any t ime, depends on several variables, including the extent of the urban complex, the nature of industry, site factors\
    such as topography and <span>proximity</span> to water bodies, time of day, and existing weather conditions.\
</p>\
<p><strong value=0 checked='false'>【】</strong>The most studied and well-documented urban climatic effect is the urban heat island.<strong value=1 checked='false'>【】</strong>The term simply refers to the fact that temperatures within\
    cit ies are generally higher than in rural areas. <strong value=2 checked='false'>【】</strong>The heat island is evident when temperature data are examined. <strong value=3 checked='false'>【】</strong>For example, the distribution\
    of average minimum temperatures in the Washington, D C., metropolitan area for the three-month winter period (December through February) over a five-year span, clearly represents a well-developed heat island. The warmest winter\
    temperatures occurred in the heart of the city, while the suburbs and surrounding countryside experienced average minimum temperatures that were as much as 3 3°C lower. Remember that these temperatures are averages, because\
    on many clear, calm nights the temperature difference between the city center and the countryside was considerably greater, often 11 °C or more. Conversely, on many overcast or windy nights the temperature differential approached\
    zero degrees.\
</p>\
<p>The radical change in the surface that results when rural areas are transformed into cit ies is a significant cause of the urban heat island. First, the tall buildings and the concrete and asphalt of the city absorb and store greater\
    quantities of solar rad iation than do the vegetation and soil typical of rural areas. In addition, because the city surface is <span>impermeable</span>, the runoff of water following a rain is rapid, resulting in a severe\
    reduction in the evaporation rate. Hence, heat that once would have been used to convert liquid water to a gas now goes to increase the surface temperature. At night, while both the city and the countryside cool by rad iative\
    losses, the stone-like surface of the city gradually releases the additional heat accumulated during the day, keeping the urban air warmer than that of the outlying areas.\
</p>\
<p>A portion of the urban temperature rise must also be attributed to waste heat from sources such as home heating and air conditioning, power generation, industry, and transportation. Many stud ies have shown that the <span>magnitude</span>\
of human-generated energy in metropolitan areas is great when compared to the amount of energy received from the Sun at the surface. For example, investigations in Sheffield, England, and Berlin, Germany, showed that the annual\
    heat production in those cities was equal to approximately one-third of that received from solar rad iation. Another study of densely built -up Manhattan in New York City revealed that during the winter, the quantity of heat\
    produced by combustion alone was 2 times greater than the amount of solar energy reaching the ground. In summer, the figure dropped to 1/ 6.\
</p>\
<p>There are other, somewhat less influential, causes of the heat island. <span>For example, the blanket of pollutants over a city contributes to the heat island by absorbing a portion of the upward-directed long-wave radiation emitted\
    at the surface and re-emitting some of it back to the ground.</span> A somewhat similar effect results from the complex three-dimensional structure of the city. The vertical walls of office buildings, stores, and apartments\
    do not allow radiation to escape as read ily as in outlying rural areas where surfaces are relatively flat. As the sides of these structures emit their stored heat, a portion is re-radiated between buildings rather than upward,\
    and is therefore slowly <span>dissipated</span>. In addition to re-rad iating the heat loss from the city, tall buildings also alter the flow of air. Because of the greater surface roughness, wind speeds within an urban area\
    are reduced. Estimates from available records suggest a decrease on the order of about 25 percent from rural values. The lower wind speeds decrease the city' s ventilation by inhibiting the movement of cooler outside air which,\
    if allowed to penetrate, wou ld reduce the higher temperatures of the city center.\

    title: "Alfred Wegener' s Theory of Continental Drift",
    passage: " <p>In 1912, the German geolog ist Alfred Wegener proposed that Earth's continents are mobile rafts of lighter crust that have shifted over time by plowing their way through the denser crust of the oceans. <strong value=0 checked='false'>【】</strong>The\
    theory, called continental drift, was partly motivated by the apparent fit, like puzzle pieces, of the coastlines of South America and Africa. <strong value=1 checked='false'>【】</strong>Wegener first presented his theory of\
    continental drift at a meeting and in a paper, and then as a book. The Origin of Continents and Oceans, published in 1915. <strong value=2 checked='false'>【】</strong> He continued to write <span>updated</span> versions of this\
    work until his death in an illfated expedition to Greenland in 1930. <strong value=3 checked='false'>【】</strong> Wegener maintained that Earth is composed of concentric shells of increasing density from crust to core. The\
    outermost shell is not continuous but made of continental blocks of lighter rock cal led sial (an acronym for silica- and aluminum-rich rock) floating in the denser sima (silica- and magnesia-rich rock) underlying the oceans.\
    All the continents had been joined in the supercontinent of Pangaea. As the continent broke up, the pieces moving apart left bits behind, explaining the presence of nonvolcanic islands and island chains, according to Wegener.\
    Where the moving pieces col lided, mountains formed. They were thrust up either by the plowing of the continents through the sima, as in the case of the Andes, or by the colliding of two blocks of sial, as in the case of the\
    Himalayas. <span>As for the force driving continental drift, Wegener initially invoked Polfluchtkraft-a force causing flight from the poles as a result of Earth' s\
    rotation-and later the tidal force resulting from the gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon and Sun.</span>\
</p>\
<p>One of the most influential geologists to join the mobilist camp, as the drifters school became known, was Arthur Holmes. Holmes recog nized the importance of rad ioactive heat-which had recently been discovered -and realized\
    that there must be a mechanism to remove it from Earth' s interior. That mechanism, he argued, is convection-the rising of less dense material and the sinking of more dense material. He went on to propose that the mantle (the\
    part of Earth' s interior below the outer crust and above the core) convects in large, circulating patterns, and that this motion carries the continents across Earth' s surface He also related crustal movement and mantle convection\
    to the evolution of mountain belts. Wegener adopted Holmes's mechanism in the last rend it ion of his theory Holmes, for his part, presented his grand concept of a dynamic Earth in his influential and popular text Principles\
    of Physical Geology, published in 1944.\
</p>\
<p>Although it was eventually supplanted by the theory of plate tectonics, Wegener' s theory of continental drift influenced science because it explained disparate observations, because it was placed in the context of existing theories,\
    and because it offered a coherent view of Earth's evolution. For example, Wegener showed not only that the coastlines on opposite sides of the Atlantic fit together, but that geolog ic features on the different continents fit\
    as well. He <span>asserted</span> that the Appalachians, which can be traced northward through the Canadian Maritime Provinces, match the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Norway. He marshaled evidence from the distributions\
    of fossi l and living species to argue that land bridges joining continents were less likely than a single continent. The example commonly <span>cited</span> is that of Mesosaurus, a shoreline scavenger reptile that lived in\
    the Permian period and is found as fossils in rocks on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean. Mesosaurus was thought not to be a great swimmer, certainly not able to cross an ocean.\
</p>\
<p>Wegener also found supporting evidence in ancient climates. <span>Mounting</span> observations indicated that the past climate of many regions was much different from the present climate. In the tropics, geologists had found sand\
    and gravel left by ancient glaciers, and in rainy reg ions they had located prehistoric deserts. Then there was the discovery, by a British exped it ion, of plant fossi ls only 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the South Pole.\
    Particularly puzzling was evidence suggesting that widely different climates in different regions had occurred at the same time, so one could not account for different climates by claiming simply that the whole of Earth was\
    once hotter or once cooler than now. Wegener solved this dilemma by showing that observations of paleoclimate could be explained if the positions of the continents had shifted relative to those of the poles. </p>",

    title: "The Development of Instrumental Music",
    passage: "<p>Until the sixteenth century, almost all music was written for the voice rather than for musical instruments \
    Even during the Renaissance (from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century), instrumental music was, for the most part, the \
    result of substituting an instrument for a voice in music written for singing or dancing The seventeenth century marked the \
    rise of music that lacked extramusical meaning Like a mathematical equation or geometric formula, the instrumental music \
    of the early modern era carried no <span>explicit</span> narrative content-it was neither a vehicle of religious expression nor a means of \
    supporting a secular (nonreligious) vocalized text. Such music was written without consideration for the associational \
    content traditionally provided by a set of sung lyrics. The idea of music as an aesthetic exercise, composed for its own sake \
    rather than to serve a religious or communal purpose, was a notable feature of the seventeenth century and one that has \
    distinguished modern Western European music from the musical traditions of Asia and Africa. \
    </p>\
    <p>Not surprisingly, the rise of instrumental music was accompanied by improvements in instruments and \
    refinements in tuning Indeed, instrumental music came to dominate musical composition at the very moment that Western \
    musicians were perfecting such stringed instruments as the violin, viola, and cello and such keyboard instruments as the \
    organ and harpsichord. By the early eighteenth century, musicians were <span>adopting</span> the system of tuning known as equal \
    temperament, whereby the octave was divided into twelve half-steps of equal size Johann Sebastian Bach' s Well-Tempered Clavier (1722) was an attempt to popularize this system to a <span>skeptical</span> musical public. The new attention paid to \
    improving instruments and systematizing tuning mirrored the efforts of scientists and philosophers to bring precision and \
    uniformity to the tools and methods for scientific inquiry. \
    </p>\
    <p>In the seventeenth century, northern Italy was the world center for the manufacture of violins. The Amati, \
    Guarneri, and Stradivari families of Cremona, Italy, established the techniques of making high-quality violins that were \
    sought in all of the great courts of Europe.<strong value=0>【】</strong> Transmitted from father to son, the construction techniques used to produce \
    these instruments were guarded so secretly that modern violinmakers have never successfully imitated them.<strong value=1>【】</strong> Elsewhere, \
    around 1650, earlier instruments were standardized and <span>refined</span>.<strong value=2>【】</strong> Also during this period amateur music making was \
    widespread, and professional performance also took a great leap forward, as a new breed of virtuosi inspired the writing of \
    treatises on performance techniques.<strong value=3> 【】</strong>\
    </p>\
    <p>Three main types of composition-the sonata., the suite, and the concerto-dominated seventeenth-century \
    instrumental music. All three reflect the baroque taste for dramatic contrasts in tempo and texture. The sonata (from the \
    Italian word for \"sounded,\" that is, music played and not sung) is a piece written for a few instruments-often no more \
    than one or two. It usually consisted of three movements of contrasting tempo-fast/slow/fast-each based on a song or \
    dance form of the time. The suite, written for any combination of instruments, is a sequence or series of movements \
    derived from various European court or folk dances-for example, the sarabande, the pavane, the minuet, and gigue, or jig \
    Henry Purcell (1659-1695) in England, Francois Couperin (1668-1733) in France, and Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) in \
    Germany all contributed to the development of the suite as a musical genre. Finally, the concerto (from the same root as \
    concert ato, which describes opposing or contrasting bodies of sound) is a composition consisting of two groups of \
    instruments, one small and the other large, playing in dialogue. The typical baroque concerto, the concerto grosso ( \"large \
    concerto\") featured several movements whose number and kind varied considerably. \
    </p><p>The leading Italian instrumental composer of the baroque era was Antonio Vivaldi (1678 -1741) Vivaldi \
    wrote some 450 concertos He systematized the concerto grosso into a three- movement form (fast/slow/fast) and \
    increased the distinctions between solo and ensemble groups in each movement Of the many exciting compositions Vivaldi wrote for solo violin and ensemble, the most glorious is The Four Seasons, a group of four violin concertos, each of which musically describes a single season. </p>",

    title: 'Pinyon Pines and Pinyon Jays',
    passage: "<p>Organisms of different species frequently evolve adaptations that make them <span>utterly</span> and specifically \
    dependent on each other for resources. For example, many trees must have mycorrhizal fungi living in their root systems, \
    fungi that are indispensable to the tree because they <span>facilitate</span> mineral uptake from the soil. In turn, the fungi rely on the \ trees to photosynthesize: they use some of the tree's chemical food as their only energy source. Such intimate relationships\
    are examples of coevolution through which two species become so interdependent that they can thrive only in each \
    other' s presence.\
    </p><p>At first glance, the relationship between pinyon pine trees and the pinyon jay does not appear to be one of \
    coevolution. Pinyan pines produce cones and seeds that attract seed predators, especially the pinyon jay. A seed, of course,\
    contains an embryonic plant for the next generation. Why sacrifice it to an animal? Some plants have poisonous seeds, an \
    obvious adaptation to reduce loss to animals. Pinyons, however, have an array of characteristics that combine to encourage\
    jays to visit the pines and help themselves to the seeds. Cones are positioned upward and outward on the tree, so the\
    seeds inside are in plain sight of the jays, essentially inviting them to <span>partake</span> Pinyan seeds are unusually large, and each\ seed is high in energy. The seed coat is thin, meaning that birds such as pinyon jays can not only ingest the seeds but also\
    digest them. In many plants, an indigestible seed coat permits the seed to pass unharmed through the bird' s alimentary\
    system. Pinyan seed coats differ in color between edible and nonviable seeds, signaling the jays as to which they should\ select.\
    </p><p>Attracting seed predators would not seem to be a successful survival strategy for pinyon pines. However,\
    pinyon jays are behaviorally adapted to bury any seeds in excess of their immediate survival needs. This is a useful behavior\
    for the jays, <span>providing</span> they can retrieve some of the buried seeds during winter, and good for the trees, as the unretrieved\
    seeds are ready to germinate. Still, for the jays to bury any seeds, there must be an abundance of seeds far beyond the\
    jays' immediate needs. One tree could never produce <span>so many seeds</span>, but if all the pinyons in a region produced heavy\
    seed crops at once, they would indeed \"flood the market\" with vastly more pinyon seeds than the local population of jays\
    could consume In fact, that is exactly what the pinyon pines do.\
    </p><p>It requires a great deal of energy to make so many seeds, so much energy that it is unlikely that a pinyon\
    population could produce such a bumper seed crop every year. More important, however, it would be to the severe\
    disadvantage of the trees to produce large seed crops annually, even if they could. Doing so would make the resource not\
    only abundant but also predictable Seed predators could, over the years, steadily build their populations, eventually \
    increasing so much that they could, indeed, consume virtually all of the seeds. It is much more adaptive for the plants to \
    produce seed cornucopias intermittently. <strong value=0>【】</strong>Doing so has several major advantages. First, energy can be stored for some years \
    and then devoted to cone and seed production, ensuring adequate energy to produce a large seed crop. <strong value=1>【】</strong>Second, seed-predator populations will decline in years of low seed production, either through starvation, reduced reproduction, or \
    emigration. <strong value=2>【】</strong>Pinyons in most areas have a roughly six-year interval between heavy seed crops.<strong value=3>【】</strong> \
    </p><p>Pinyan jays have so completely adapted to the cycle of the pinyons that their reproduction is tied to it. \
    Most species of birds mature sexually in response to changes in day length. In pinyon jays, however, day length is only one \
    stimulus for reproduction. The other cue is availability of pinyon seeds. When seeds are abundant, jays can breed very early \
    in spring continue breeding through summer, and reenter breeding condition as early as the winter solstice. So the jay \
    population temporarily enlarges in response to one of the intermittent large crops of pinyon seeds. But the increase in the \
    population of jays is less than the increase in the size of the seed crop. Thus many of the seeds of a bumper crop are buried \
    and subsequently germinate, many more than would germinate without planting by the jays.</p>",

    title: 'Building Materials',
    passage: "<p> It is difficult to exaggerate the radical change that the new industrial world of the nineteenth century brought to architectural materials Since the beginning of architectural history, the same basic substances had been employed. They were provided directly by nature and used in their natural or near-natural state, only cut, shaped, and dried into the functional forms of timbers, stone blocks, and clay bricks. The exceptions were lime mortar and Roman concrete. Metals, which had the tensile strength that masonry materials lacked, were employed in minor and supplementary ways. Bronze was expensive as well as brittle Iron, the structurally more important metal, was available in limited quantities and uneven quality, and was too easily converted to rust by the elements. It was, therefore, restricted in use to things such as tie-rods and chains, and, along with bronze, to masonry clamps and decoration. Prior to the nineteenth century, the structural presence of iron in architecture was scarcely noticeable. </p><p> The Industrial Revolution changed all that Iron materials became available in such large quantities that they could play far more than a minor architectural role In 1800, the world production of iron stood at 825,000 tons, by 1830 it was 1,825.000 tons, and nearly 40,000,000 in 1900-an increase of almost SO-fold over the century. The growth was not only in quantity, but quality as well. Iron, found <span>bountifully</span> in Earth' s crust as an oxide, is a material of almost protean variability It is not simply pure or impure, but can be made hard or soft, brittle or ductile, strong or weak. These qualities depend on carbon content, freedom from impurities (slag), and heating and cooling treatments of the refined metal. Traditionally, three versions existed: cast iron, wrought iron, and steel. Cast iron is the <span>crudest</span> form, containing the most impurities and thus being extremely brittle. Wrought iron, because it includes almost no carbon, is highly malleable (hence its name), but also comparatively soft. The optimum material is steel, which incorporates a restricted amount of carbon for hardness but is otherwise free of impurities, giving it great strength, and which, as a result of tempering treatments, is also malleable. </p><p> Cast and wrought iron came into prodigious manufacture in the early and mid -nineteenth century as a result of rapid growth in demand, new means to transport materials, and more efficient iron-founding techniques. But the mass production of steel required further technological innovations to rid the metal of weakening impurities and to control more perfectly the amount of carbon added Such advances were made with the Bessemer process (put into use in 1860) and the open-hearth process of 1864, scientific iron metallurgy in the last third of the century perfected these techniques. </p><p> A significant but little-known fact is that the mam form of increased steel production was technically not steel but a kind of wrought iron. It lacked a crucial property of true steel-its hardening power-yet it differed from the older forms of wrought iron because it was free from the weakening presence of slag, at the same t ime being malleable (unlike cast iron). It was called steel only because the name carried the status of a high-quality and high-priced product. </p><p> Another alternative new building substance was concrete, composed of an aggregate of broken stone, gravel, or other small chunks of hard matter embedded in a matrix of lime, sand, and water First used in Roman times, its modern <span>revival</span> depended on the invention of portland cement in 1824, a substance of many times greater strength, durability, and fire resistance t han ancient lime cement Mass-produced concrete began to come into widespread use in the 1850s and 1860s, in the construction of the sewers of Paris, for example <strong value=0>【】</strong><span>However, even with portland cement, the use of concrete was still severely restricted by its low tensile strength, but the remedy was at hand in the newly available iron and steel; their properties complemented those of concrete.</span><strong value=1>【】</strong> The latter material was cheap, easily molded into large structural forms with great compressive but little tensile strength. <strong value=2>【】</strong> Iron and steel, on the other hand were expensive, difficult to shape, yet endowed with extreme tensile strength and easily procurable in the simple form of long, thin bars.<strong value=3>【】</strong></p>",

    title: 'Dealing with Extreme Cold',
    passage: "<p> There are a number of environments in which organisms are exposed to temperatures below 0°C and thus the risk of freezing. In polar regions, terrestrial organisms are exposed to freezing temperatures for most of the year. In more temperate regions, they may have to tolerate several months of winter, when subzero temperatures <span>persist</span> for long periods of t ime. High mountains are another place where there is permanent snow and ice, even at the equator. Exposure to subzero temperatures may occur on a daily and/or seasonal basis. </p><p> Endothermic animals (warm-blooded animals) can stop their bodies from freezing by generating their own heat. They retain heat because of the insulation provided by feathers or fur, and the layer of fat beneath the skin. <strong value=0>【】</strong>Other heat <span>conservation</span> measures include huddling together, recovering heat from exhaled breath, and recovering heat from the extremities of the body. <strong value=1>【】</strong>Endotherms can remain active in the cold if they can find enough food, or they can reduce their metabolism and lie dormant until warmer cond it ions return. <strong value=2>【】</strong>Although air temperatures may be low, the temperature beneath an insulating layer of snow, under the ground, or at the bottom of a lake may remain above 0°C. <strong value=3>【】</strong>Most organisms, however, can neither generate their own heat nor avoid the freezing temperatures, and for them, the choice is to survive ice formation within their bodies or to prevent their bodies from freezing. </p><p> Organisms run the risk of freezing at temperatures that are below the melting point of their body and cel l fluids. There are two main responses: either they can survive ice forming within them (they are freezing tolerant) or they have mechanisms that ensure that their flu ids remain liquid at temperatures that are below the freezing point of water and the melt ing point of their body fluids (they are freeze avoid ing). The strategy that an organism uses depends on the structure and physiology it has developed during its evolutionary history and on the particular demands of its environment. If the organism is living in a wet or damp environment, ice is likely to make contact with its surface when its surroundings freeze This may cause its body flu ids to freeze by the ice traveling across the cell or body wal l, or through body openings-a process known as inoculative freezing. Most organisms surviving low temperatures in such environments are thus likely to be freezing tolerant, since inoculative freezing will cause their bodies to freeze Some, however, may have a structure such as a cuticle, eggshell, cocoon, or sheath that allows them to prevent inoculative freezing by acting as a barrier to the spread of ice into their bod ies This allows them to maintain their body or cell fluids as liquids, despite the fact that their surfaces are in contact with external ice, and enables them to avoid inoculative freezing. <span>In a situation where the organism is likely to be exposed to subzero temperatures with little or no water in contact with its surface (many terrestrial insects, for example), it does not have the problem of inoculative freezing and it is perhaps easier for it to ma intain its body fluids in a liquid state at low temperatures and thus survive by avoiding freezing. </span></p><p> The two strategies of cold survival are, however, not always mutually exclusive. There have been a few reports of insects that were apparently freezing tolerant switching to being freeze avoiding. The overwintering larvae of a beetle from northern Indiana, when studied in the winters of 1977-1979. froze at -8°( to -12°( but survived down to -28°(. When examined again in 1982, however, they froze and were killed at -26°(, apparently switching from a freezing-tolerant to a freeze-avoiding strategy during the <span>intervening years</span>. There are adaptations in common between freeze-avoiding and freezing -tolerant insects that may make it easy to switch between the two strategies. It must be said, however, there has been only one other report of an insect, another beetle, displaying a shift in strategy of this sort. One Antarctic nematode is freezing tolerant when <span>immersed</span> in water but, when free of surface water, there is, of course, no inoculative freezing and it can survive by avoiding freezing. The cold-tolerance strategy displayed thus depends on the particular characteristics of the animal's microenvironment.</p>",

    title: 'Ancient Greek Pottery ',
    passage: "<p> An extremely important and long-standing industry in ancient Greece was the ceramics industry, giving rise to the huge number of pieces of pottery archaeologists and historians pore over. In reality, pottery production can almost be seen as a combination of a natural resources -based economy and a production-based economy, as the primary material-good clay-was a resu lt of the natural geology. However, not all city-states made equal use of their clay resources, and only two-Corinth and Athens-were really active in pottery export in the Archaic Age (750 -500 BC) and following. [ Pa ragraph 2] As with weaving, pottery no doubt began as, and in many places remained, a household industry, probably practiced <span>exclusively</span> in the summer when the clay and kindling wood were drier and easier to transport and burn But evidence of a more concentrated effort at production for export appeared already in the Bronze Age (3000-1 100 B c.) and continued in the Dark Ages (1100-800 B c ), as with the <span>copious</span> export of Euboean scyphi (drinking cups) to such locations in the Mediterranean as Cyprus, the Levant, and even Italy. These were fol lowed by the Corinthian cups and scyphi, and finally the Athenian kylix (a shallow type of wine goblet). The demand for Greek vessels to drink out of appears to have stemmed from a desire for Greek things to drink, and amphorae and pithoi (storage vessels), especially from Attica, also proliferated in the Mediterranean. </p><p> This need for commercial production led to the rise of workshops and factories. Such workshops were usually family-owned businesses run by the head of the household, his sons (and possibly daughters), and, depending on the size of the industry, additional servants and/or slaves. The general assumption concerning many professional potters is that they were not citizens of the cities in which they worked. In Athens, these were the metics, or resident aliens, as wel l as slaves. The identity of the workers in the primary ceramic working area in Corinth-the Potters' Quarter-is uncertain. But an inscribed pottery shard naming the Phoenician goddess Astarte suggests that there were Phoenician immigrants (from what is now Leba non) working there, or at least a heavy Phoenician influence. </p><p> Happily for modern researchers, many artisans signed their works. <strong value=0>【】</strong>This gives an idea not only of who these ancient ceramicists were, but also of how labor was divided.<strong value=1>【】</strong> Modern scholars have the names of a few potter-families from sixth-century B c Athens: Nearkhos, who worked with his sons Tleson and Ergoteles: Ergotimos, who was succeeded by his son Eukheiros (literally, \"Good Hand\" ); and Amasis and his son Kleophrades, who produced pottery from the mid -sixth century B c to the dawn of the fifth.<strong value=2>【】</strong> The signatures ind icate, however, that although these men fashioned and fired the ceramics, others were employed to paint the more <span>elaborate</span> figural vases.<strong value=3>【】</strong> Such artists traveled around to different workshops, like the sixth-century Epictetus, whose name as a painter accompanied about six different names of potters. </p><p> Starting around 550 B.C., numbers were scratched onto the bottoms of some vases, often appearing after the name of the vase in full or abbreviated form. These may have been batch numbers, indicating groups of pots fired together and intended for specific merchants or markets. <span>The merchants were also indicated by markings on some vases, whereby a signature sign or abbreviation indicated to which exporter or importer in the receiving city the pottery was destined</span> In the sixth century B c ., such merchants were frequently lomans (Greeks from cities on the Mediterranean coast of Asia Minor), who were responsible for much of the import-export business at Naucratis in the south and Gravisca in the west. </p><p> But the most important markings from the point of view of economics are the actual \"price tags\" etched into some pots. An important difference in the price occurred between painted and undecorated vases, with a markup of anywhere from 25 to 50 percent for the figural vases. Clearly, this was because the pottery manufacturer had to pay for the additional labor. </p>",
